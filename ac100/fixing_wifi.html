Cutting the shielding between wifi adapter and LCD should solve the problem. I had my doubts, but it worked fine for me on my AC100-10V.</span></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Warning: following the steps is completely on your own risk! Don&rsquo;t blame me if your AC100 is bricked afterwards.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Open the display: remove the two small screws on the lower left and right of the display, right above the frame joints. The screws are covered by a plug. Use a flat item (a knife or a screwdriver) to carefully split the display front from its back. Note that this display was obviously not designed to be reopened, the small plastic bolts may break.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>If you are successful, you can see the wifi adapter (red ellipse).</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="461" src="images/image01.jpg" width="615"></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Use a sharp knife to cut the shielding between wifi adapter and LCD (see the red line).</span></p><p class="c0"><img height="464" src="images/image02.jpg" width="619"></p><p class="c2 c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>I broke a small bolt, so the wifi adapter was no longer fixed.
